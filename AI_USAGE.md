# AI Usage Documentation

## How AI Was Used to Build This Project

### 1. Planning
- **AI Help:** Asked for project ideas combining APIs, web scraping, and AI.
- **Result:** Chose Mediastack API + TechCrunch scraper + DeepSeek for sentiment analysis.

### 2. Coding Help
- **Web Scraper:** AI provided starter code for scraping TechCrunch. I updated it with the correct HTML tags, and then there was issues with the code so i debugged it.
- **API Code:** AI showed how to use the Mediastack API. I added error handling.
- **DeepSeek Integration:** AI helped create the prompt to get sentiment and summary in a format easy to parse.

### 3. Debugging
- **Problem:** `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'pandas'`,also issues with venv when running the code.
- **Fix:** AI explained to use `python3` and `pip3` instead of `python` and `pip, and helped on how to install the venv and to set the requirements..

- **Problem:** `ImportError: cannot import name 'MEDIASTACK_API_KEY'`
- **Fix:** AI suggested checking for typos and restarting the terminal.

### 4. Documentation
- **README.md:** AI provided a template. I filled in my specific details.

## What Was AI-Generated vs Human-Written
- **AI:** Code examples, documentation templates.
- **Me:** Putting everything together, fixing errors, testing, and customizing all code.
